        <p class="tagline">Rebellions arenâ€™t born. They are forged.</p>
        <p>
          On Kerti Island, where knowledge is scarce and belongs solely to the regime, Zea is a Truth Seeker: scholar, polymath, advisor, prisonerâ€”born and raised to serve. But she is done serving. Her fate will be hers to decide. And her plan might just be the spark that ignites a revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ax, a thief, doesnâ€™t care about rebellionâ€”only money. But what if even the right price canâ€™t buy freedom under tyranny?
        </p>
        <p>
          Veyre, a soldier, is sworn to uphold order, hunting down rebels without question. But can she keep her honor when the orders no longer demand loyaltyâ€”but her conscience?
        </p>
        <p>
          Tricks, lies, and secrets uphold the Great Leadersâ€™ regime. And tricks, lies, and secrets will bring it to its knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for Kerti Island to rise, they need more than hope. More than a plan. More than a spark. Above allâ€”they need the right story.
        </p>
        <p><em>And sometimes, a story is all it takes.</em></p>
  
        <p>
          For readers who love a high-stakes rebellion like <strong>Andor</strong>,  
          Zukoâ€™s redemption arc, the strategic heists and found family of  
          <strong>Six of Crows</strong>, and the clash of power and truth found in  
          <strong>Dune</strong> and <strong>1984</strong>.
