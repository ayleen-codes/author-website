        <p class="tagline">Rebellions aren‚Äôt born. They are forged.</p>
        <p>
          On Kerti Island, where knowledge is scarce and belongs solely to the regime, Zea is a Truth Seeker: scholar, polymath, advisor, prisoner‚Äîborn and raised to serve. But she is done serving. Her fate will be hers to decide. And her plan might just be the spark that ignites a revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ax, a thief, doesn‚Äôt care about rebellion‚Äîonly money. But what if even the right price can‚Äôt buy freedom under tyranny?
        </p>
        <p>
          Veyre, a soldier, is sworn to uphold order, hunting down rebels without question. But can she keep her honor when the orders no longer demand loyalty‚Äîbut her conscience?
        </p>
        <p>
          Tricks, lies, and secrets uphold the Great Leaders‚Äô regime. And tricks, lies, and secrets will bring it to its knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for Kerti Island to rise, they need more than hope. More than a plan. More than a spark. Above all‚Äîthey need the right story.
        </p>
        <p><em>And sometimes, a story is all it takes.</em></p>
  
        <p>
          For readers who love a high-stakes rebellion like <strong>Andor</strong>,  
          Zuko‚Äôs redemption arc, the strategic heists and found family of  
          <strong>Six of Crows</strong>, and the clash of power and truth found in  
          <strong>Dune</strong> and <strong>1984</strong>.
